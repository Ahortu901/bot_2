### Alpaca Trading with Reinforcement Learning

This project demonstrates the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for creating an automated trading system using Alpaca's trading API. The model leverages advanced RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) to make trading decisions in real-time across multiple assets such as stocks or commodities (e.g., AAPL, GOOG).

The environment simulates stock trading with real-time market data fetched from Alpaca, includes transaction costs, stop-loss mechanisms, and safeguards like maximum position size and leverage limits to help prevent large losses.

### Features:

Alpaca Integration: Fetches real-time market data and executes buy/sell orders through the Alpaca API.
Reinforcement Learning Models: Implements PPO and A2C algorithms for training adaptive trading strategies.
Multiple Assets: Supports trading with multiple assets (e.g., AAPL, GOOG).
Risk Management: Includes features like stop-loss thresholds, maximum position size, and leverage limits to reduce the risk of substantial losses.
Transaction Costs: Models realistic transaction costs while making trades.
Gym Environment: Custom trading environment built with OpenAI Gym for RL integration.
